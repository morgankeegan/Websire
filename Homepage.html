      <br>
      This photo stems from 2017 from when i had Deutschklasse, we were to asked to make a psudo 'family' for class activities and well, this is the product.
      <br>
      Due to this, i have made a plethora of memes involving this image photoshoped to a degree.

  <h1>Favorite book: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road" target="Road">The Road</a></h1>
  <img src="Face/Road.jpg" alt="Picture of the cover of the road" class="center">
  <p>The Road is a 2006 novel by American writer Cormac McCarthy. It is a post-apocalyptic novel detailing the journey of a father and his young son over a period of several months, across a landscape blasted by an unspecified cataclysm that has destroyed most of civilization and, in the intervening years, almost all life on Earth. The novel was awarded the 2007 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction in 2006. The book was adapted to a film of the same name in 2009, directed by John Hillcoat.</p>
